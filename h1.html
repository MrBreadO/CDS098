<div class="Why">
    <br><h1>Why Recycle??</h1><br>
        <p>Given the trouble we already have with our tight schedule, you might think we don’t need it as much. But do you know a formidable 91% of the world’s plastic is still not recycled yet instead it ends up being burnt, polluting our oceans, littering the fields etc. </p>
        <p>The only real possible solution out of the plastic pollution is to stop manufacturing more plastics but at the same time we need to recycle more the mess we’ve already made and save the planet’s ecosystem by choosing recycled plastic products. Here are the ways on how recycling plastics will benefit us.</p><br>
    <h3>Protecting Wildlife. </h3> 
        <p>Even if it’s a small scale, recycling helps wildlife by eliminating the risk of animals consuming recyclable waste or getting trapped and injured by garbage. Sorting recyclables into outdoor commercial recycling bins also helps to preserve their habitats.</p><br>
    <h3>Saving Energy.</h3>
        <p>Recycling plastics save us a huge amount of energy, reduces resource extraction, lower carbon emissions etc. Just a single recycled plastic bottle can conserve enough energy to light a 60W light bulb for up to 6 hours.</p><br>
    <h3>Reducing greenhouse gases.</h3>
        <p>To make virgin plastic it’s necessary to burn petroleum which in turn creates an enormous amount of harmful greenhouse gases. By recycling plastic instead of producing it from scratch, we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.</p><br>
    <h3>Creating Jobs.</h3>
        <p>The recycling industry offers thousands of jobs in sorting, collecting, processing and also manufacturing.</p><br>
</div>

<div class="How">

<br><h1>HOW TO RECYCLE?</h1> <br>

<h2>1. Collection + distribution.</h3>
    <p> most initial step recycling process is the collection of post-consumer materials from homes, businesses, and institutions.  This can be done by either local government or private companies. Another option is taking plastics to communal collection points such as designated recycling bins or facilities.</p><br>
<h2>2. Sorting + categorizing.</h3>
    <p>The next step in the plastic recycling process is sorting. Since there are several types of plastic, we need to separate it from each other by recyclers. Further, plastics might be sorted by other properties such as colour, thickness, and use which will be done by machines and it’s one of the most important step which will help us avoid the contamination of end products.</p><br>
<h2>3. Washing.</h2>
    <p>Washing is a critical step in the plastic recycling process since it removes the impurities that can hold back the operation, or completely ruin a batch of recycled plastic. The impurities targeted in this step commonly include things such as product labels and adhesives as well as dirt and food residue.</p><br>
<h2>4. Shredding.</h2>
    </p>Next the plastic is fed into shredders, which break it down into much smaller pieces. These smaller pieces can be processed in the next stages for reuse. Additionally, the resized plastic pieces can be used for other applications without further processing, or can be simply sold as a raw material.
        Breaking down the plastic into smaller pieces also allows for any remaining impurities to be found which helps us find contaminants such as metal, which may not have been removed by washing but can be easily collected with a magnet at this stage.</p><br>
<h2>5. Identification and separation of plastics.</h2>
    <p>In this step, the plastic pieces are tested for their class and quality. First, they are separated based on density, which is tested by floating the particles of plastic in a container of water. Next is the test for “air classification”, which determines the thickness of the plastic pieces which is done by placing the shredded plastic into a wind tunnel, with thinner pieces floating while larger pieces stay at the bottom.</p><br>
<h2>6. Extruding + compounding.</h2>
    <p></p>At last, recycling process step is where the particles of shredded plastic are transformed into a usable product. Then it is melted and crushed together to form pellets</p><br>

    <p>Why choose Poly Trocas??</p> <br>
    <p>We aim to raise awareness about the harmful impact of plastic on our environment.<br> Our resources make recycling easy and encourage sustainable habits.
        In India, more than 26 tons of plastic waste are generated per day, most of which ends up polluting the environment. Poly Trocas contributes directly to the reduction and elimination of this plastic crap that is currently dumped in landfills, rivers or oceans.<br>
        Together, we can push for better recycling practices.
